Welcome to your new TanStack Start app! 

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `pnpm add @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss --dev`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. The following scripts are available:


```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm check
```


# Paraglide i18n

This add-on wires up ParaglideJS for localized routing and message formatting.

- Messages live in `project.inlang/messages`.
- URLs are localized through the Paraglide Vite plugin and router `rewrite` hooks.
- Run the dev server or build to regenerate the `src/paraglide` outputs.


## Shadcn

Add components using the latest version of [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
```


## Setting up Better Auth

1. Generate a `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` value:

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx @better-auth/cli secret
   ```

2. Store it in `.dev.vars` for local Worker runtime and in Wrangler secrets for production.

3. Visit the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com) to unlock the full potential of authentication in your app.

## Database And Environments (Cloudflare D1)

This app uses Cloudflare Workers + D1 in runtime and Drizzle ORM for schema/migrations.

### Environment model

You only need two logical environments:

1. Local
2. Production

Wrangler is the runtime configuration layer for both.

### Local setup

1. Keep app-level values in `.env.local` (tooling/build-time only):

```env
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

2. Keep Wrangler local runtime values in `.dev.vars` (copy from `.dev.vars.example`):

```env
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-local-secret
```

3. Ensure D1 binding exists in `wrangler.jsonc` under `d1_databases` with binding `ed_app_db`.

### Production setup

1. Set non-secret Worker vars (for example `BETTER_AUTH_URL`) in `wrangler.jsonc` or dashboard.
2. Set secrets using Wrangler:

```bash
wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
```

3. Use the same D1 binding name (`ed_app_db`) in production.

### Drizzle + D1 workflow

Generate SQL migrations:

```bash
pnpm run db:generate
```

Apply migrations locally to D1:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate:local
```

Apply migrations remotely to production D1:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate:remote
```

Run an ad-hoc SQL query against local D1:

```bash
pnpm run db:query:local -- "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
```

Run an ad-hoc SQL query against remote D1:

```bash
pnpm run db:query:remote -- "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
```



## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])
  
  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.
